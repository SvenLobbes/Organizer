# Organizer

An not finished iOS App for creating and listing tasks and events.
I am sure about, that this app doesnt look really impressive. It shows how to store Userdata in the NSUserDefaults and how to use them in TableViews. 
There are many unfinished TableViewCells, but the idea of showing previously saved Userdata works perfect.
